This python code configures and reads the Parallax L3G4200D gyroscope module via SPI

I did not convert it to radians per second or degrees per second, but there are plenty of 
documents on the web stating how to do that.

Notes on SPI:  I implemented just two SPI functions:  init and transfer
Future options would be bulk SPI transfer and SPI shutdown (disable synchronous serial port)
