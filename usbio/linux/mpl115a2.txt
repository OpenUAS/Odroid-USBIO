Notes:

(1)  This code to read the MPL115A2 barometric pressure and temperature unit is nearly complete.
The code to use the coefficients to modify the baro and temp values is not working as yet.
That code was modeled after the Arduino library for the device.  I suspect the issue is with
my python code not converting negative values to float properly.
  Example:   0x7201 is positive while 0xB201 would be negative (per arduino library)

(2)  I had to issue an extra i2c_read() after requesting 8 bytes.  Not sure why this is so, but if
I do not the PIC will quit responding to USB on subsequent i2c queries.  It maybe related to the
i2c MPL115A2 device itself (or my understanding of i2c).
